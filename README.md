# VBA-challenge
Module 2 Challenge - Moderate Level with Bonus Task

Instructions:

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
  * The ticker symbol.
  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  * The total stock volume of the stock.

**Note:** Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

Bonus Task: Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to allow it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) just by running the VBA script once.

Things to consider:
  * Make sure that the script acts the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA is that it takes the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with one click of a button.

Submission Checklists:
  * A screen shot for each year of your results on the multi-year stock data.
  * VBA scripts as separate files.
  * README.file
